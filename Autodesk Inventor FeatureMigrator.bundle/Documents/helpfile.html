    <h3>Usage</h3>
    Once installed, the FeatureMigrator add-in will create a new button in the ‚ÄúTools‚Äù Tab of the Assembly Ribbon (an assembly document needs to be active).<br />
<br />
When pressing this button, the FeatureMigrator add-in will display a new browser in the Inventor Browser Pane. This browser will display only the supported features for migration in the active assembly. <br />
At this point only the following assembly features are supported for migration:<br />
-	ExtrudeFeature<br />
-	HoleFeature<br />
-	CircularPatternFeature (only patterning Extrude and Hole)<br />
-	RectangularPatternFeature (only patterning Extrude and Hole)<br />
See the screenshots for a more detailed description of the FeatureMigrator control:<br />
<br />
<B>Migrating Assembly Features to Parts</B><br />
The user can migrate assembly features either by selecting them in the FeatureMigrator browser: by right-clicking on one or several of them, then use the ‚ÄúSend to Parts‚Äù commands. Features can also be directly migrated from the regular Inventor Model browser: using the context menu item added by the add-in. In that case, the context menu item will be available only if the selection contains only features and if they are all of a supported type mentioned above.<br />
<br />
When migrating an assembly feature to the parts, the FeatureMigrator will create a copy of the affected part documents and replace the original part by this copy for each occurrence affected by the assembly feature: an assembly feature can affect several occurrences of the same part differently, so the operation will often end up with more copies than original documents. <br />
When creating a copy of a Part, the FeatureMigrator will use by default the name of the occurrence to generate a new file name. If a file with the same name exists on the disk, this file will be replaced by the copy automatically, unless it is referenced by an existing Inventor document: for example the generated filename is ‚Ä <a href="Part1_1.ipt" title="Part1_1.ipt">Part1_1.ipt</a> ‚Äù. This file already exists at the same location and is referenced by a drawing file ‚Ä <a href="Part1_1.idw" title="Part1_1.idw">Part1_1.idw</a> ‚Äù. In this situation, the FeatureMigrator will display the ‚ÄúFile Overwrite‚Äù dialog, prompting the user for a new name to affect to the generated copied part.<br />
<br />
The ‚ÄúFile Overwrite‚Äù dialog also informs about which documents are referencing the concerned part.<br />
<br />
<B>Feature Migration Results</B><br />
Once the operation of migrating features is completed, the FeatureMigrator will display a dialog that provides information about the results: This first dialog is a ‚Äúhigh-level‚Äù report of the migration. It provides the opportunity for the user to select the action to take for all the assembly features migrated {Suppress if Succeeded, Suppress always, Delete if Succeeded, Delete always or Nothing}, also for the part features that haven‚Äôt been migrated correctly {Suppress, Delete or Nothing} (Features created by the add-in can be in an invalid state in the parts for a number of reasons).<br />
<br />
The high-level report dialog also provides access, through ‚ÄúDetailed Report‚Äù button, to a much more detailed report dialog.<br />
In this second dialog, the result of the migration of each selected assembly feature can be visualized: It provides details about the status of each part feature (and the ability to set an individual action for each feature {Suppress, Delete or Nothing}), the documents that were generated to replace the assembly occurrences affected and the documents that became unreferenced as a result of the operation (those documents can be deleted upon user selection).<br />
<br />
<B>Associativity Between Part & Assembly Features</B><br />
Associativity is controlled by the browser available in the Part document, displayed by activating the command under Tools Tab -> FeatureMigrator Panel -> Controller button.<br />
This browser will list all the existing features resulting from a migration by the tool and that are of supported type for associativity (only hole & extrude at the moment: holes & extrusions resulting from migration of a pattern won‚Äôt be supported for associativity).<br />
The update is not automatic (upon opening the part) but has to be performed by the user: ¬´ Update from Assembly ¬ª context item.<br />
In case the assembly file cannot be located   <a href="http://i.e." title="i.e.">i.e.</a>   location or filename has changed), a file resolution dialog will be displayed, prompting the user to find the original assembly file. If the assembly cannot be located, the features won‚Äôt be updated.<br />
